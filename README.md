## Measurement Converter

#### By Brian Scherner

#### An application that converts measurements from metric to imperial.

## Description

This application allows users to enter a measurement unit, which will then be converted from the metric system to the imperial system. A window alert will display the conversion of kilometers to miles, kilometers to feet, liters to quarts, liters to gallons, milliliters to cups, and milliliters to ounces.

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* JavaScript

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone this repository to your desktop.
* Navigate to the index.html file in the directory.
* Open index.html in your browser.

## Known Bugs

I would like to come back and make it so that the results of the functions are displayed on the page, instead of in a window alert. I would also like to add more measurments, and figure out how to organize code into a more organized, smaller, and efficient system.
